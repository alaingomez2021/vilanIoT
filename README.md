# ViLanIoT

ViLanIoT is a visual language with an abstract, concrete and semantically defined syntax. In its design, a graph-like structure was chosen as a starting point since IoT networks can be modeled as graphs considering the devices as the "nodes" and the relationships between them as "edges".

The use of ViLanIoT offers the following advantages:
- An easy-to-learn tool to make a quick representation of IoT systems compared to other tools that have a more demanding learning process.
- A tool to represent existing IoT systems and in design process applicable to different IoT domains, such as Smart Home, Smart Industry and Smart Grid.
- A tool capable of representing the cyber-physical nature of IoT system components and their functional implications.
- A tool that does not require previous specialized knowledge of other tools or frameworks.

ViLanIoT diagrams shows the structure of IoT systems considering these systems as a set of interconnected elements. Two aspects of IoT systems are represented by functional diagrams: the functions performed by the devices and the communication between them. By using functional diagrams it is possible to visualize the flow of information from its generation to its consumption by the user or its storage and/or processing in a cloud services platform.

Here you can find VilanIoT resources such as Library images and diagram examples.

# Key Concepts

- **IoT system**: It is a system made up of objects, human users and "things".
- **Things**: The fundamental element of the IoT paradigm is "things". These can be virtual elements or devices.
- **Virtual element**: Those elements that do not have a defined physical counterpart, but abstract concepts of interest for the representation of the functionality and structure of IoT systems.
- **Human user**: As part of the IoT paradigm, human users are part of the system and through the use of devices can perform different tasks according to their needs. The human user establishes interaction with the devices.
